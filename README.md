# eskisozluk-clone
Simple site, that enables user to add posts with titles, created using React and Django frameworks.

To start the project you have to install the dependencies for the app by running:
```
npm install
```
command in the Views directory where package.json file is placed.

This will create a directory named 'node_modules' containing the dependencies.

To start the server where Raect will work you should run:
```
npm run start
```
command in the Views directory where webpack.config file is placed.

On the other hand you will need to run the server where Django app lives.

After creating a virtual enviroment you should install the required packages specified in requirements.txt running:
```
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```
command.

Lastly, after activating your virtual enviroment, you should run:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
